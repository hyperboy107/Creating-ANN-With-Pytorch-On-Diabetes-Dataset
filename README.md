Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using PyTorch to analyze the Diabetes dataset. This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and contains various features such as glucose level, blood pressure, and body mass index, along with a target variable indicating diabetes diagnosis.

By leveraging PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, we can construct a neural network model to predict diabetes based on the input features. PyTorch provides a flexible and intuitive interface for designing neural networks and training them on large datasets efficiently.

Diabetes prediction web app -> Install Dependencies: npm init -y, npm install express
